# Attributes are:

#	op   str  "operator"	Operator name, for LPD spooling.
#	au   flag not-present	If present, authentication required
#				note that if ca and sp are both set,
#				ca will be tried first and then sp
#	am   str  none		Comma separated list of uams to use
#				(for every printer) whenever 
#				authentication is on
#	ca   str  not-present	If present, use cap-style authentication
#				directory to place print authentication files

#
# Some examples:
#
#	On many systems (notably not Solaris), no papd.conf is required,
#	since papd shares the same defaults as lpd.
#
#	A simple example:
#
#		terminator:\
#			:pr=lp:op=wes:\
#			:pd=/usr/share/lib/ppd/HPLJ_4M.PPD:
#
#	An example with authenticated printing:
#		authprn:\
#			:pr=|/usr/bin/lpr -Plp:\
#			:pd=/usr/share/lib/ppd/HPLJ_4M.PPD:\
#			:sp:ca=/tmp/print:\
#			:am=uams_clrtxt.so:
#
#	Note also that papd.conf can list several printers.
#
#	The printer name in papd may be a full NBP-name of the form
#	name:type@zone, for example:
#		Printer 1:LaserWriter@Printing and Mailing:\
#			:pr=|/usr/bin/lpr -Plp1:
#
# Warning: If you are using more than 15 printers and you do not
# specify the zone in the printer name, only some of the printers may
# appear in the Chooser.
